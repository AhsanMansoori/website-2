**What we did today...Jan 25, 2018**

Got Anaconda installed! Yes! Opened up Jupyter and talked about its features. Then we briefly did some computation. Next class, we will delve into the details regarding basics of Python in [Python fundamentals 1](https://nyudatabootcamp.gitbooks.io/data-bootcamp/content/py-fun1.html). Feel free to work through this on your own.

**What we did today...Jan 23, 2018**

We talked...a lot. I told you about the course (big ideas, [course website](https://nyu.data-bootcamp.com/undergrad_outline/), materials, the [syllabus]((https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_syllabus.pdf))), who I am, and I asked about you!

We also tried to download Anaconda installation of python, but ran out of time. Next class we will get it done and start learning.

**January 18, 2018: Welcome to Data Bootcamp...**

Welcome to Data Bootcamp!

This is a very exciting course…the world is awash in data and being able to (i) harness, (ii) analyze, and (iii) communicate the analysis in a compelling way are must have skills for today and for the future. Employers are looking for them and you will be a better employee. And I'm looking forward to helping you acquire these skills.

In less than a week we will have our first meeting and get the semester started. I want to reach out to you about some features of this course to help you prepare for the semester ahead.

(1) Read the Syllabus. I’ve posted the syllabus for the upcoming semester at our course website:

https://nyu.data-bootcamp.com/undergrad_outline/

This has information about important dates, texts, grading, etc. Please take some time to go over this prior to our first class meeting.

(2) Make sure you have a laptop computer you can bring to class and install your own programs on. This is a must. We will be writing programs in every class.

(3) Take the online survey. This link below:

has a survey for you to complete. Completing this will partially go towards your participation / professionalism grade.

(4) Explore the website. The website provides a bunch of information about the course, FAQ, data, code, etc.

I'm looking forward to meeting you all and a great semester!
