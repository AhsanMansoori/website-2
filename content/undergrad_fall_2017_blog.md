# THE BLOG: Undergrad Fall 2017

**September 11, 2007...What we did today**

Great day!!! Lots accomplished....

- We setup Anaconda, checked the version, opened Ipython and wrote <br>
```
print("hello world")
```

- We checked out Spyder (editor, Ipython console, object console) and then ran our first program from Spyder checking out our version number.
- We downloaded the [maddison_data_input.py](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Lab/blob/master/Maddison_data_input.py) from GitHub and then ran the program --- we got our first experience, downloading, manipulating and plotting data.
- We talked a bit about projects. Please spend sometime thinking about three project ideas and bring them to class on Wednesday.

Next class, [Python fundamentals 1](https://nyudatabootcamp.gitbooks.io/data-bootcamp/content/py-fun1.html), check out the book to prepare.

**September 11, 2017...Where should Amazon's new headquarters be?**

Amazon asked this interesting question last week...it made a lot of news as the prospect of thousands of new jobs in any locality will have many consequences (some good, maybe bad?). But this question is a great data question, its not like Bezos said, "I'm really feeling Boston now, thus we will locate there". No, Amazon wants to find the place best fits their needs...well how do you determine that...with data!

The Upshot at the New York Times beat us to it. Here is there analysis:

As you go through this article and associated graphic (I do think the graphic is boring and uninformative), think about those questions we discussed in class:
- what is the story?
- where did the data come from?
- what more would you like to know?

The Wall Street journal has a related article about places for companies to locate...

**September 6, 2007...What we did today**

Welcome to the class, great start!!!

- We talked about the idea behind the course, what you should expect, and some details regarding deliverables. Took a tour of the course materials.
- We setup our directory for which we will always work from, store files, etc.
- We downloaded Atom (if you use another text editor great) and created a `.csv` file.
- We checked out GitHub, created a repository, then up loaded our file to this repository.

Want to get ahead, download Anaconda distribution!

**September 5, 2017...My Project Idea**

The semester is about to start and---along with you---I will execute a project. Over the past couple of days, I've been thinking of ideas and here is one of them.

Here is the issue: We just saw a hurricane devastate the Houston, Texas area. Economically, this area is interesting as it is the epicenter of petroleum refining for the United States. Suppose that you are an executive at some company, you might ask, well how will this affect my business?

Suppose that none of your customers are in Houston and none of your suppliers are in Houston. So no effect right? Not so fast, suppose that *your supplier uses supplies* from a company that is located Houston. Now, via the fact that production is interlinked amongst suppliers, indirectly your company is impacted by the hurricane.

But how would you learn/anticipate this outcome? It turns out that public companies must report large customers in their regulatory filings. From these reports, one can construct the "network" of interlinked firms. Economic and finance researchers have done this, see [Cohen and Frazzini, 2008](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~af227/pdf/Economic%20Links%20and%20Predictable%20Returns%20-%20Cohen%20and%20Frazzini.pdf) or [Atalay, Hortacsu, Roberts, Syverson](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/13/5199.short) and I'm thinking it may be interesting to compile this data myself and ask some questions of it.

A couple of "big picture" points about this project:

- First, there is an important lesson here in that there is wealth of public information available that can be used to answer interesting questions. In this case, the SEC wants investors to understand how firms may be exposed to risks associated with their customers. But this same information can allow you to understand more subtle linkages between firms by connecting the data. In other words data intended for one purpose can sometimes be used for other interesting purposes. How do you link it, well that's why your in this course...


- Second, this project is non-trivial. It requires access to certain datasets (I need to see if I can get them); it will require the ability to read and interpret company names (i.e. I have to handle strings); it will require the ability to conceptualize, interpret, and communicate what I find to the relevant audience.

What do you think? Let me know.

**August 21, 2017: Before the First Class Meeting...**

* Make sure you have a **laptop computer** you can bring to class and install your own programs on.  This is a must.  We will be writing programs in every class.

* Join the **[discussion group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/databootcamp_fall2017_undergrad)**

* Sign up for a **[GitHub](https://github.com)** account and **email me your username.**

* Bring a **nameplate** to class.  If you don't have one, type your first name in this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mDKqDO-48wbwYfFEGD0BAYJRsshRRRxR9IEKhekTWM/edit?usp=sharing), print it, and fold it in thirds.
* Familiarize your self with the course website. Spend some time and read the Syllabus, explore the FAQ, data sources, etc.

**August 21, 2017: Welcome to Data Bootcamp...**

Welcome to Data Bootcamp!

This is a very exciting course...the world is awash in data and being able to (i) harness, (ii) analyze, and (iii) communicate the analysis in a compelling way are _must have skills_ for the future. Employers are looking for them and you will be a better employee. I'm looking forward to helping you acquire these skills.  

Much of the day-to-day work will focus on how to use Python. In other words, the "harnessing" part of data analysis. However, harnessing data is not an end in itself, but a necessary step to be able to analyze and communicate data to help make better decisions. I will use this blog to focus on these latter aspects (analysis and communication) and do so by discussing interesting uses of data that I find on the web.

I will also use this blog to announce any changes in the course, reminders, things to watch etc. For example, the next blog post will discuss what you need to do to be prepared for the fist day of class.

Finally, the blog is NOT a substitute for the discussion group. The **[discussion group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/databootcamp_fall2017_undergrad)** is intended for discussion amongst your selves. I'll participate as well and
