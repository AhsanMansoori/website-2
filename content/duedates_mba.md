[Spring Break, have fun]

**March 21** <br> Submit [Revised Project Ideas](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).
(We're willing to let this slide till April 4.  The point is that you should start thinking
about your project as soon as the exam is over.  But if you want to take another week to think about this, do it.)

Recommended but not graded:  [Optional Code Practice B](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_practice_b.pdf).
-->


**April 4** <br> Submit [Project Proposal](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).

**April 20** <br> Submit [Data Report](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).  This is really a little late; we urge you to think about data from the beginning. Ask for help if you're not sure you have what you need.

Recommended but not graded: [Optional Code Practice C](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_practice_c.pdf).

**May 5** <br> Submit project by email to nyu.databootcamp@gmail.com. The subject line should be "bootcamp project mba".  The file name should be your last names separated by dashes and a short title;  eg, something like *Jones-Smith-Zhang-India.ipynb*. See [Project Guide](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf) for additional information.

We're willing to give you another week, but the absolute latest time a project can be submitted is **5pm May 12**.  No exceptions.  Keep in mind that this is the last possible time, not a target; you're more than welcome to submit your project earlier.  And honestly, you don't want this to drag on any longer.
