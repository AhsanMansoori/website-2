# Data Bootcamp

A course at **NYU Stern** exploring **economic and financial data** with the **Python** programming language. The course was developed by Stern faculty and students with the assistance and support of executives at **Amazon**. The immediate goal is to train students to succeed as summer interns and full-time employees of technology companies, but the same skills are valued in finance, marketing, consulting, media, and other areas. We think of it as literacy for the modern age.

More concretely, the course is designed to (i) introduce students to sources of economic, financial, and business data and (ii) give **programming newbies** a sense of how modern software -- in this case Python -- makes life easier and more interesting. We'll let data speak for itself. As for coding: It's a skill that opens doors to new **career opportunities**. You can do lots of things in Excel, but if you value your time -- and you should -- you'll find you can do more, and do it more quickly, with a modern programming language. We like to say we do it because we're lazy, laziness being a synonym here for efficiency.

If that doesn't convince you, there's more on our [FAQ]({{< ref "faq.md" >}}).

## Before the first class

* Make sure you have a **laptop computer** you can bring to class and install your own programs on.  This is a must.  We will be writing programs in every class.
* Join a **discussion group:** [UG](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyu_data_bootcamp_ug) | [MBA](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyu_data_bootcamp_mba).
* Bring a **nameplate** to class.  If you don't have one, type your first name in this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mDKqDO-48wbwYfFEGD0BAYJRsshRRRxR9IEKhekTWM/edit?usp=sharing), print it, and fold it in thirds.
